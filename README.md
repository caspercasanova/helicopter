Currently trying to replicate the helicopter model from the cool game Nuclear Option. 

This is alot of GPT + novice game dev programming 

My main gripe is currently momentum dies out pretty quickly when going from a high point to a low point, I need to figure out the math to improve forward vectoring. I have a sneaky suspicion it will work with "dynamic" coefficients of lift based on angle of the helicopter and power.

Todo: 
- [ ]  "Dynamic Flight Model" i.e. updating the coefficients of lift, drag and power based on thrust and aircraft angle. 
- [ ]  Reduce the number of magic numbers and reduce hard coding of calculation
- [ ]  Improve my math + phyics + vector calculus skills.
- [ ]  Add a wench to lift objects (should update the base weight of the aircraft i assume)
- [ ]  Make rotor blades spin (minor in my book)
